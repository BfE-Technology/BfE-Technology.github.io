Our student projects are organised by our student chapters at the start of their academic term. We also have projects under the global team open year-round to students and professionals at various experience levels. The commitment levels are designed to take into account your full-time study/work schedule and will be specified in each project.

We are also actively seeking experienced students or professionals to fill some vacancies in the global technology leadership team or to join our global mentor network. The commitment level for global leadership roles is typically less than a project, but depends on the actual responsibilities assigned and your personal interest. The commitment level for mentors is highly negotiable; you may choose to join our network first, and commit only when there are questions from students pertaining to your area of expertise and when you are free.


Browse our open roles and projects now at <a href="https://opps.bridgesforenterprise.com/technology/">this page</a>. For mentorship applications, you may check out our <a href="https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com">main website</a> or email technology@bridgesforenterprise.com to find out more.

"How is joining BfE Tech any different from other tech projects available at university and work?"

**We are startup-like.** We are a new division within BfE, meaning that there are plenty of opportunities to apply technology that hasn't been explored within the organisation. You can wear many hats! If you have an idea about what you want to do in BfE, we will provide you with the resources to fulfil it.


**We are established.** Founded in 2015, BfE has established an extensive network of students, professionals and entrepreneurs around the world, allowing you to make many meaningful connections and even forge new partnerships on behalf of BfE Technology. We have a wide range of talent and connections within BfE Technology from experienced undergraduates to PhDs, full-time professionals and tech consulting firms; everyone is here for you to bounce ideas off and get advice regarding BfE or non-BfE work. At the moment, we are working hard to develop training materials to consolidate our experience and pass on the knowledge to new members.


**We are local.** Our student chapters organise many in-person events and meetups to engage you with BfE members and mentors from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, enabling you to build connections within your geographical region. We are currently based in the UK, Singapore, the US, the Netherlands and Canada - and actively expanding our footprint across the world.


**We are global.** We have many global virtual events and updates keeping everyone informed of the ongoings in BfE and allowing you to connect to people in places you have never been before. Most of our tech work is done via online collaboration, so there is no geographical limitation regarding where you should be.


**We are secure. ** As we work with many different stakeholders and handle sensitive data, we are very careful about ensuring data protection and security in every aspect of our code. Before making it fast, we first make it work and make it right.


**We are adventurous.** We never shy away from learning and approving new technologies to improve the way we code and analyse things at BfE. BfE was founded on the belief that the better we are at our work, the greater the impact we have for our startups, students and mentors. This belief underpins our thirst for innovation within BfE Technology.


**We are impact-minded.** Unlike most university projects and hackathons, the code you write for BfE will directly address real business needs both internally and for our stakeholders, including real companies accessing BfE's resources and advice, making an instant, tangible social impact on a global scale.


**We go above and beyond.** Unlike doing a corporate job, everyone is involved in BfE on a voluntary basis, meaning that we are not here to be a small cog in a big machine and focus just on our small bit of code, but to take ownership and enact changes we believe will better serve our cause. We also echo with the principle of open-source code, and whenever we can (that is, without compromising the security of our users' data), we encourage you to open-source a modified version of the code you have done in BfE as our way to give back to the tech community.

Featured project:
- Some of the cool data we have looked at include startup application data, crowdfunding data and web traffic data for SEO optimisation.
- While some of us use NLP tools to help recommend investors for a given startup, others are looking at startup-mentor matching formulated as a graph matching problem, or advising the development of a voting system for startup selection. If you see a bunch of people arguing over maths on a whiteboard or getting all hyped about a new ML library in Python, that is us!
