    Whether you are a junior engineer looking to expand your portfolio and skills, a senior professional eager to translate your valuable work experience into scalable social impact, or a university student passionate about tech and entrepreneurship, BfE Technology is the place for you. 
    <br><br>
    With BfE's 4 types of service offerings, 80+ startups, 200+ students and 200+ professionals across EMEA, Asia and Americas, a huge amount of data go in and out of the organisation on a day-to-day basis. The rapidly growing global user base makes it challenging to keep the community connected and our resources as accessible as possible, an issue only made worse by the covid pandemic. BfE Technology Division was founded in Aug 2020 to address these needs, replacing the previous Data Analytics team in BfE to encompass a much wider spectrum of work.  
    <br><br>
    At the Technology Division, we design and deploy cutting-edge techonological tools to scale BfE's services for social entrepreneurs in the developing world. Our work covers a wide range of technology disciplines. As long as you enjoy tech, there is almost always something for you wherever your skills and interests lie. 
    <br><br>

  DataAnalytics: We perform data analyses to understand the effectiveness of our strategies and operational models, and work with other divisions to implement our proposed suggestions. We come from a mix of business and technology backgrounds, and enjoy using a minimalist framework to address the most sophisticated business needs. Some of the cool data we have looked at include startup application data, crowdfunding data and web traffic data for SEO optimisation.

  WebAppDev: We are the largest group in BfE, spearheading an ambitious initiaitve to build an extensive online platform for every aspect of BfE's work. We love building various things from small cute tools to large platforms, and abhor clicking our mouse like a caveman. We are soon releasing our self-hosted website and intranet, with various integrations with our internal tools such as Slack and Hubspot to connect the awesome people in BfE across the world. Many exciting features and apps are being proposed and developed by our teammates from around the world.

  MLAlgo: We design and implement advanced algorithms and machine learning tools to automate complex decision-making processes in BfE. While some of us use NLP tools to help recommend investors for a given startup, others are looking at startup-mentor matching formulated as a graph matching problem, or advising the development of a voting system for startup selection. If you see a bunch of people arguing over maths on a whiteboard or getting all hyped about a new ML library in Python, that is us!

  DevOps: DevOps knowledge is increasingly important, if not essential, for anyone working or aspiring to work as a software engineer. We design and implement DevOps processes from continous integration, testing to deployment, improving code collaboration across the globe. While we are only at our beginning with a minimal set of CD/CI configurations via GitHub Actions, we have many possible additions planned down the road to help manage our codebase and make the tech kids' life easier. The nature of our work means that we are involved in many high-level decision making in the Technology Division.

  CloudSecurity: Many in-house technology projects rely on our servers on cloud, which needs to host our data securely, communicate with clients in different regions with low latency, and be managed within our budget. We work with DevOps to manage our new infrastructure-as-code process and investigate security loopholes in both our code and our server setup. We occassionally work with DataOps and our internal legal advisors to make sure our tech work is compliant with GDPR regulations.

  DataOps: DataOps in BfE refers to design and management of our internal database and any operational procedures that can alter our database, usually by people outside the Technology Division (as the other case is handled by DevOps). We work very closely with the global leadership to establish protocols for various procedures in BfE, and develop a clear vision of our own about how BfE's organisational structure should transform to meet our strategic needs. We code less often than the rest, usually in the context of database management or automation with DevOps. But when we do code, we rock.

  BrandingDesign: We report primarily to BfE's Outreach Division. When we are in Tech, it is usually to convert the branding strategies and guidelines developed in Outreach into standardised stylesheet files that will be enforced within Tech. We are usually people who are passionate about front-end development, UI deisgn, digital media and branding.

  TechnicalAdvisory: We reporting directly to BfE's Incubation Division, although we share many training and partnerships with Technology. We provide technical consulting to our startups as part of BfE's flagship incubation programme. As our startups range from solar energy firms to blockchain companies, we have not just programmers but also mechanical enginners, electronic engineers, material scientists, medical students... and many more. For programmers, it is easy and often encouraged for people on the internal projects to switch over to our side, and vice versa.

  why: |
    <strong>We are young.</strong> We are a new division within BfE, meaning that there are plenty of opportunities to apply technology not yet explored within the organisation. If you have an idea about what you want to do in BfE, we will provide you with the resources to fulfil it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We are old.</strong> Founded back in 2015, BfE has established an extensive network of students, professionals and entrepreneurs around the world, allowing you to make many meaningful connections and even forge new partnerships on behalf of BfE Technology. We have a wide range of talents and connections within Technology from experienced undergraduates to PhDs, full-time professionoals and tech consulting firms; they are there for you to bounce ideas upon and get advice regarding BfE or non-BfE work. At the moment, we are working hard to develop training materials to consolidate our experience and pass on the knowledge to new members.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We are local.</strong> Our official student chapters organise many in-person events and meetups to engage you with BfE members and mentors from a wide spectrum of background, enabling you to build connections within your geographical regions. They are currently based in UK, Singapore, US, Netherlands and Canada, and actively expanding to have our footprints across the world.
    <br><br> 
    <strong>We are global.</strong> We have many global virtual events and updates keeping everyone informed of the ongoings in BfE and allowing you to connect to people in places you have never been before. Most of our tech work is done via online collaboration, so there is no geographical limitation regarding where you should be.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We are conservative. </strong> As we work with many different stakeholders and sensative data, we are very careful about ensuring data protection and security in every aspect of our code. Before making it fast, we first make it work and make it right.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We are adventurous. </strong> We never shy away from learning and approving new technologies to improve the way we code and analyse things at BfE. BfE was founded on the belief that the better we are at our work, the greater the impact we have through BfE, which underpins our quench for innovation at BfE Technology.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We are on the ground.</strong> Unlike most university projects and hackathons, the code you write for BfE will directly address real business needs from BfE as an organisation and from our stakeholders including real companies accessing BfE's resources and advice, making an instant tangible social impact on a global scale.
    <br><br>
    <strong>We go above and beyond.</strong> Unlike doing a corporate job, everyone is involved in BfE on a voluntary basis, meaning that we are not here to be a small cog in a big machine and focus just on our small bit of code, but to take ownership and enact changes we believe will better serve our cause. We also echo with the principle of open-source code, and whenever we can (that is, without compromising the security of our users' data), we encourage you to open-source a modified version of the code you have done in BfE as our way to give back to the tech community.

  how: |
    Our student projects are organised by our student chapters at the start of their academic term. We also have projects under the global team open all year round to students and professionals at various experience levels. The commitment levels are designed to take into account of your full-time study/work schedule, and will be specified in each project.
    <br><br>
    We are also actively seeking experienced students or professionals to fill some vacancies in the global technology leadership team or to join our global mentor network. The commitment level for global leadership roles is typically less than a project, but depends on the actualy responsibilities assigned and your personal interest. The commitment level for mentors is highly negotiable; you may choose to join our network first, and commit only when there are questions from students pertaining to your area of expertise and when you are free.
    <br><br>
