Whether you are a junior engineer looking to expand your portfolio and skills, a senior professional eager to translate your valuable work experience into sizeable social impact, or a university student passionate about tech and social impact, BfE Technology is the place for you. 
    
At the Technology Division, we design and deploy cutting-edge techonological tools to scale BfE's services for social entrepreneurs in the developing world. Our work covers a wide range of technology disciplines, and there is almost always something for you wherever your skills and interests lie. If you enjoy creation and innovation, and if you care deeply about making an impact with your code, drop us an email today at technology@bridgesforenterprise.com.

roles: 
    DataAnalytics: With BfE's 4 types of service offerings, 80+ startups, 200+ students and 200+ professionals across EMEA, Asia and Americas, huge amounts of data go in and out of the organisation on a day-to-day basis. Technology members at BfE perform analyses at various levels to understand the effectiveness of our strategies and operational models, identify pain points and insights, propsose relevant suggestions and work with other divisions to enact the changes. These projects often require members to sit at the intersection of technology and consulting, using a minimalist framework to address the most sophisticated business needs. Some of the things we have done include analysis on startup application data, crowdfunding sources data and web traffic data, which inspires suggestions on improvement of our SEO and Google Ads strategy.

    WebAppDev: BfE's rapidly growing global user base makes it challenging to keep the community connected and make our resources as accessible as possible, an issue that was only made worse by the covid pandemic. To this end, the Technology Division is spearheading an ambitious initiaitve to build an extensive web infrastructure for BfE over the next few years. At the moment, it includes our self-hosted website, intranet and their various integrations with our internal tools such as Slack and Hubspot, which will bring significant benefits to our social entrepreneurs working hard to serve their local communities. We are still at an early stage with loads of potential and possibilities - our first version of these websites are about to release soon, while many exciting advanced features and new apps are being proposed and developed by our team across the world. 

    MLAlgo: BfE's nonprofit nature means that all our students and professionals are volunteers, who choose to devote their precious time outside working and studying to our cause. As BfE continues to scale, it becomes infeasible for many operations and analyses to be done manually. While many of these needs can be addressed by sound business analysis and good web automation tools, some of them are difficult in a theoretical sense, calling for design of more advanced algorithms involving machine learning, statistics and optimisation. For example, our members are using Natural Language Processing to understand unstructured textual data and build an in-house algorithm to rank a list of potential investors for a given startup profile. Other examples include an algorithm for matching startups with professional mentors, a voting system for startup selection and many more to come.  

    DevOps: DevOps knowledge is increasingly important, if not essential, for anyone working or aspiring to work as a software engineer. Just like any organisation that runs large-scale projects with contributions from multiple team members, BfE actively employs DevOps to enact continous integration, testing and deployment, improving code collaboration across the globe. While we currently use a set of minimal CD/CI configurations via GitHub Actions, there are many potential additions that can robustify our process and make life easier for our programmers. DevOps members are also involved in managing our GitHub and many high-level decision making in the Technology Division, helping the division to grow at a sustainable pace.

    CloudSecurity: Many in-house technology projects rely on our servers on cloud, which needs to host our data securely, communicate with clients in different regions with low latency, and be managed within our budget. If cloud engineering and security are for you, you will get to work together with DevOps team on our recently adopted infrastructure-as-code infrastructure and investigate security loopholes from software code to our server architecture. On the other hand, as a significiant portion of BfE's users are based in EU, we need to make sure that we comply with GDPR regulations from our website codes to our server setup. This work is often conducted jointly with the DataOps team and our internal legal advisors.

    DataOps: DataOps is an ambiguous term often interpreted as DevOps for data. In BfE, this is defined in a broader sense to encapsulate management of any operational procedures that can alter our database, usually by people outside the Technology Division (as the other case is handled by DevOps). DataOps team work very closely with the global leadership team to understand and establish protocols for how different types of data flow through BfE, and develop a clear vision of how BfE's organisational structure should transform to meet our strategic needs. While the coding work required for DataOps mainly concerns maintaining the integrity of our MySQL database and file system, DataOps team also gets to work with DevOps in automating data integration processes.

    BrandingDesign: Reporting primarily to BfE's Outreach Division, branding and design people are involved in the Technology Division's work to translate their branding strategies and guidelines into standardised stylesheet files to be enforced for the technology team. This role is for you if you are interested in front-end development and digital design.

    TechnicalAdvisory: Reporting directly to BfE's Incubation Division, Technical Advisory is one of the four pillars of BfE's flagship incubation programme, providing technical consulting services to social enterprise startups in the developing world. The projects are not necessarily coding-based, and can span a wide spectrum from anything the internal team does to manufacture engineering, electronic engineering, material science, medical consulting and many more. Our internal projects and technical advisory projects are housed together under the local technology teams. Whenever possible, members are welcome to try out both internal and external projects to gain different experiences.
