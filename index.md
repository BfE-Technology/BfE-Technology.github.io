        Whether you are a junior engineer looking to expand your portfolio and skills, a senior professional eager to translate your valuable work experience into scalable social impact, or a university student passionate about tech and entrepreneurship, BfE Technology is the place for you. 
       <br><br>
       With BfE's 4 types of service offerings, 80+ startups, 200+ students and 200+ professionals across EMEA, Asia and Americas, a huge amount of data go in and out of the organisation on a day-to-day basis. The rapidly growing global user base makes it challenging to keep the community connected and our resources as accessible as possible, an issue only made worse by the covid pandemic. BfE Technology Division was founded in Aug 2020 to address these needs, replacing the previous Data Analytics team in BfE to encompass a much wider spectrum of work.  
       <br><br>
       At the Technology Division, we design and deploy cutting-edge techonological tools to scale BfE's services for social entrepreneurs in the developing world. Our work covers a wide range of technology disciplines. As long as you enjoy tech, there is almost always something for you wherever your skills and interests lie. Drop us an email today at technology@bridgesforenterprise.com to explore how you can make a global impact from home with something you love.

    DataAnalytics: We perform data analyses to understand the effectiveness of our strategies and operational models, and work with other divisions to implement our proposed suggestions. We come from a mix of business and technology backgrounds, and enjoy using a minimalist framework to address the most sophisticated business needs. Some of the cool data we have looked at include startup application data, crowdfunding data and web traffic data for SEO optimisation.

    WebAppDev: We are the largest group in BfE, spearheading an ambitious initiaitve to build an extensive online platform for every aspect of BfE's work. We love building various things from small cute tools to large platforms, and abhor clicking our mouse like a caveman. We are soon releasing our self-hosted website and intranet, with various integrations with our internal tools such as Slack and Hubspot to connect the awesome people in BfE across the world. Many exciting features and apps are being proposed and developed by our teammates from around the world.

    MLAlgo: We design and implement advanced algorithms and machine learning tools to automate complex decision-making processes in BfE. While some of us use NLP tools to help recommend investors for a given startup, others are looking at startup-mentor matching formulated as a graph matching problem, or advising the development of a voting system for startup selection. If you see a bunch of people arguing over maths on a whiteboard or getting all hyped about a new ML library in Python, that is us!

    DevOps: DevOps knowledge is increasingly important, if not essential, for anyone working or aspiring to work as a software engineer. We design and implement DevOps processes from continous integration, testing to deployment, improving code collaboration across the globe. While we are only at our beginning with a minimal set of CD/CI configurations via GitHub Actions, we have many possible additions planned down the road to help manage our codebase and make the tech kids' life easier. The nature of our work means that we are involved in many high-level decision making in the Technology Division.

    CloudSecurity: Many in-house technology projects rely on our servers on cloud, which needs to host our data securely, communicate with clients in different regions with low latency, and be managed within our budget. We work with DevOps to manage our new infrastructure-as-code process and investigate security loopholes in both our code and our server setup. We occassionally work with DataOps and our internal legal advisors to make sure our tech work is compliant with GDPR regulations.

    DataOps: DataOps in BfE refers to design and management of our internal database and any operational procedures that can alter our database, usually by people outside the Technology Division (as the other case is handled by DevOps). We work very closely with the global leadership to establish protocols for various procedures in BfE, and develop a clear vision of our own about how BfE's organisational structure should transform to meet our strategic needs. We code less often than the rest, usually in the context of database management or automation with DevOps. But when we do code, we rock.

    BrandingDesign: We report primarily to BfE's Outreach Division. When we are in Tech, it is usually to convert the branding strategies and guidelines developed in Outreach into standardised stylesheet files that will be enforced within Tech. We are usually people who are passionate about front-end development, UI deisgn, digital media and branding.

    TechnicalAdvisory: We reporting directly to BfE's Incubation Division, although we share many training and partnerships with Technology. We provide technical consulting to our startups as part of BfE's flagship incubation programme. We are not all programmers; we have manufacture enginners, electronic engineers, material scientists, medical students... depending on our startups' needs. When we do have programming-based projects though, we love to have people from the internal projects over and we like to switch over to internal projects too, just for a different experience!
